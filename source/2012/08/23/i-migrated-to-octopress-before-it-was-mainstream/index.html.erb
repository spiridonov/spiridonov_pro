title: "I migrated to Octopress before it was mainstream"

<p>Actually not. There are already hundreds of people who have migrated from bulky Wordpress / Blogger / etc to static blog engines. You can find most of them <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/Octopress-Sites">here</a>. But in contrast with millions of Wordpress users static blogs are not mainstream yet.</p>

<p>Pros of this migrations for me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Octopress is very fast.</strong> You write markdown pages and then Jekyll generates static HTML pages. So you don`t need databases or even any programming languages on server`s side.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheaper or free hosting.</strong> It`s easy to find free hosting for static HTML pages. I deploy on Amazon S3. Actually it`s not free, but my total cost is only a few cents.</li>
  <li><strong>It`s funny!</strong> I can write Ruby, Markdown, SASS&hellip; I can fix or tweak everything. I can use Git for blog posts. Hacker`s way:)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuring-and-customizing">Configuring and customizing</h2>

<p>Customizing of theme took almost all my time. I took several open source themes for Octopress, mixed them and customized layout, header and syntax highlighting. Configuring and customizing the rest code was easy enough and took less time.</p>

<p>As you may know I had a Wordpress blog before that and there is a easy way to migrate from it to Octopress. All you need is to convert your Wordpress .xml import file with ExitWP tool. I got some problems with original ExitWP, so then I tried chitsaou`s fork.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> This is a framework for hackers! So you always will tweak it, fix it, deploy pages after each change and write scripts for that:) But it`s cool! I like it:)</p>

<p>I copied ExitWP result from <code>build/jekyll/spiridonov.pro</code> to my Octopress folder, ran <code>rake generate</code> and then I got a problem during generation (yes, again):</p>

<pre>
<code>
Configuration from /Users/stanislav/development/spiridonov/spiridonov_pro/_config.yml
Building site: source -&gt; public
/Users/stanislav/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/jekyll-0.11.2/lib/jekyll/convertible.rb:29:in `read_yaml': invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII (ArgumentError)
</code>
</pre>

<p>The problem is that my locale settings are wrong. It can be fixed with <code>export</code> locale environment variables. I don`t want to do it every time from shell, so I just put this code into my 
<code>Rakefile</code>:</p>

<pre>
<code>
ENV[&lsquo;LC_CTYPE&rsquo;] = &lsquo;ru_RU.UTF-8&rsquo;
ENV[&lsquo;LANG&rsquo;] = &lsquo;ru_RU.UTF-8&rsquo;
</code>
</pre>

<p>After I got tons of converted markdown files I had to fix them all. Almost all defects were about images, but there were also layout and links defects.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of small fixes I made in my code. I don`t want to describe all of them here. You can find full sources on my GitHub page, if you want.</p>

<h2 id="dual-language">Dual Language</h2>

<p>In order to practice language I decided to write articles in English. But what should I do with two-years archive in Russian? At first I decided to delete it and start new blog and new life:) But finally I decided to delete worse half of it and keep the rest in a separate folder.</p>

<p>Octopress is very flexible! I can make several index pages (actually I want they to look like blog archive), one for Russian articles and one for English. The English one will be the root index page. I put <code>language: en</code> option into YAML config of each page/post and then made index pages, navigation and footer sensitive to this <code>language</code> option.</p>

<p>It would also be cool to change language of Disqus comments according to post`s language. I found one way to do this, though it doesn`t work for Disqus 2012. So I`m still looking for better approach. Put this into <code>source/_includes/disqus.html</code>:</p>

<pre>
<code>
var disqus_config = function () {
  {% if page.language == &lsquo;ru&rsquo; %}
    this.language = &ldquo;ru&rdquo;;
  {% else %}
    this.language = &ldquo;en&rdquo;;
  {% endif %}
};
</code>
</pre>
