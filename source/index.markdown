Hi, my name's Stas Spiridonov.

I'm a software engineer and enthusiast. I'm currently working at [Castle](http://castle.co/) as a Software Engineer. I was born in Siberia and now live in Samara, Russia. What else would you like to know?

* I'm deep into metal music. I enjoy visiting live concerts and [here is a list](/concerts) of bands I've seen live so far.
* I love travelling and taking photos. [Take a look at a map](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=ziVaddBS2p-0.kqGf9Lw-1rNk) of countries and cities I've visited. And I love hiking.
* I'm a DIY person. I cook, fix my cars, TIG weld, build RC models, build custom car parts, etc.
* I ocasionally play guitar and [record covers](/covers) by myself. I help my friends with sound recording and mixing.
* Also I like drawing [pencil portraits](/drawings).
* I love calisthenics and running, and previously was doing crossfit and olympic weightlifting.
