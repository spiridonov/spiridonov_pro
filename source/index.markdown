Hi, my name's Stas Spiridonov.

I'm a software engineer. Currently I'm open for hire! I have 11 years of experience in software development and you can take a look at [my resume here](/resume_stanislav_spiridonov.pdf). I was born in Siberia and now live in Samara, Russia. What else would you like to know?

* I'm deep into metal music. I enjoy visiting live concerts and [here is a list](/concerts/) of bands I've seen live so far.
* I love travelling and taking photos. [Take a look at a map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LANm8dHR8LlrDBA8Onw_2SgB4Vs&usp=sharing) of countries and cities I've visited. And I love hiking.
* I'm a DIY person. I cook, fix my cars, TIG weld, build RC models, build custom car parts, etc.
* I ocasionally play guitar and [record covers](/covers/) by myself. I help my friends with sound recording and mixing.
* Also I like drawing [pencil portraits](/drawings/).
* I love rock climbing, calisthenics and running (half-marathon finisher), and previously was doing crossfit and olympic weightlifting.
