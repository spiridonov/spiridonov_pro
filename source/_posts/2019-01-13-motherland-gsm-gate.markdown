I always get angry when I have to deal with mobile phone roaming. Mobile phone is not truly _mobile_ when it comes to travelling. Yes, incmoing/outgoing SMS and calls are still doable, but it always costs a fortune. Even in Russia we used to have a local roaming when moving between regions inside the country. Hopefully it is not the case anymore, it has been recently prohibited by a federal law. In most countries it is possible to buy a local SIM card with some minutes and even data. It is always way cheaper than doing calls in roaming. The rest is done from public or hotel wi-fi.

It seems like nobody uses SMS for messaging nowadays considering all those free and easy to use internet messengers. However SMS is widely used for 2-factor authentication, one-time passwords and other verification codes. My bank sends me one-time passwords for every online transaction from my credit cards. So while my iphone is used with a local SIM card I have to take another phone (usually old and simple) to be able to receive SMS messages. Hopefully incoming SMS messages are free in roaming.

For local calls I can use a local SIM card. For calling my parents or friends I can use FaceTime, Viber, Skype, whatever. To call a landline or any person without internet connectivity (for example, grandma) it is easy and cheap to use Viber Out or Skype.

So, is it really a problem? For me - yes.

Once, When I was in Dubai I fell sick badly. I was alone in my hotel room, not able to get up from a bed. I decided to call a doctor, but before that I tried to contact my insurance company. The only way to do that is to call a hot line. I tried to call via Viber Out. 

## Modem

I've got a Huawei E1550 stick. It is pretty old, but solves the problem perfectly. There are plenty of other models out there, just check this [compatibility table](https://github.com/bg111/asterisk-chan-dongle/wiki/Requirements-and-Limitations) and choose any.
