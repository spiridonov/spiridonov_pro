Pure Armenian beauty! This portrait proves that I really love drawing dark hair:)

By the way, I usually write only couple of sentences in these portraits blog posts. Do you want me to write more? Maybe some stories connected with this person or portrait, or tips and tricks on drawing?

*Take a look at all my drawings [here](/drawings)*
