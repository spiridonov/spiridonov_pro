Gojira is one of my favorite bands. I love these guys for brutal riffs and melody. Here is my cover on their song called L'Enfant sauvage. It's my first song recorded completely in Logic X. I used to work in Nuendo before. Although, I still use the same gear, so only my recording and mixing skills are different from song to song:) Enjoy!
