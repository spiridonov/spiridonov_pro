_Make them suffer_ is a series of posts about Akka and Scala. [Previously](/2015/10/08/akka-internal-state) we discussed how to avoid concurrency problems and keeping internal actors state isolated. In this episode I want to share my thoughts on code organization and naming for Akka. This is not my ultimate solution to the problem, it is still an open question.
