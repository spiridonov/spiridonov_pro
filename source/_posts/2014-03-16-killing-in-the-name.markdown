Here is my fresh cover on legendary Rage Against The Machine. Check it out!

It's been recorded on my ESP KH-2, Engl, Maxon and Whammy. The sound isn't even close, because of EMG and preamp. And I know I do the same mixing mistakes every time, I'm still learning. I hope I will do better some time:)
