I read mostly articles and blog posts from different sources every day. Zite and Pocket are my best friends. But sometimes I read books, you know, these huge epub/pdf files with hundreds of pages. And here I want to share some of them with you.

## The Goal

{% img right /images/books/the_goal.jpg %}

The Goal is written in a form of novel, a piece of fiction. Actually that makes book extremely interesting and easy to read, you can complete it in four to six evenings. It describes the role of bottlenecks in a manufacturing process, how to find them and how to maintain a process of ongoing improvements. As a side story there is a story about Alex's (main character) relationships with his wife. The author thinks that the same Theory of Constraints can be applied to relationships as well.

## Remote

{% img right /images/books/remote.jpg %}

One more book from 37signals. It describes all aspects of remote working I've met in different sources so far. You may find this book not deep enough, just like "Look! Working remotyle is very cool!". But actually it covers everything and I agree with every point there. Target readers inculde people who want to work from different cities or countries, as well as workers who want to spent just part of day/week working outside office and thier employers. How to organize your home office, how to communicate with the rest of your team, how to score your work and so on...
