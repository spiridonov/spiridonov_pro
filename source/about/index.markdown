{% img center /images/about.jpg It's me in Porvoo, Finland:) %}

My name is Stanislav Spiridonov, I\`m a software engineer and enthusiast. I\`m currently working at [Cloud Castle](http://cloudcastlegroup.com/) as a Ruby developer. I was born in Siberia and now live in Samara, Russia.

What else would you like to know? I\`m into metal music. I play guitar and [record covers](/music) by myself. I help my friends with sound recording and mixing. I enjoy visiting live concerts and [here is a list](/about/bands_list) of bands I\`ve seen live so far. Also one of my hobbies is drawing of [pencil portraits](/drawings). I\`m single. I train calisthenics and formerly did running anf olympic weightlifting. I like travelling and taking photos. [Take a look at a map](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=ziVaddBS2p-0.kqGf9Lw-1rNk) of countries and cities I\`ve visited.

I\`m open for hire. It\`s interesting for me to try different kinds of projects. If you have an idea for a project, I'd love to discuss it with you. Also feel free to contact me if you have any offers on music or sound recording.
