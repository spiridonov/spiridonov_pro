{% img profile-image /images/about.jpg %}

My name is Stanislav Spiridonov, I\`m a software engineer and enthusiast. I\`m currently working at [Cloud Castle](http://cloudcastlegroup.com/) as a Ruby developer. I was born in Siberia and now I live in Samara, Russia.

What else would you like to know? I\`m into metal music. I play guitar and record covers by myself. I draw pencil portraits and really love it. I\`m single. I\`m a long distance runner and former weightlifter. I like travelling and taking photos.

I\`m open for hire. It\`s interesting for me to try different kinds of projects, simple ones as well as large applications. If you have an idea for a project, I'd love to discuss it with you.
