{% img center /images/about.jpg It's me in Porvoo, Finland:) %}

My name is Stas Spiridonov, I'm a software engineer and enthusiast. I'm currently working at [Castle](http://castle.co/) as a Software Engineer. I was born in Siberia and now live in Samara, Russia. What else would you like to know?

* I'm into metal music. I enjoy visiting live concerts and [here is a list](/about/bands_list) of bands I've seen live so far.
* I ocasionally play guitar and [record covers](/music) by myself. I help my friends with sound recording and mixing.
* Also one of my hobbies is drawing of [pencil portraits](/drawings).
* I love calisthenics and running, and previously was doing crossfit and olympic weightlifting.
* I love travelling and taking photos. [Take a look at a map](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=ziVaddBS2p-0.kqGf9Lw-1rNk) of countries and cities I've visited.

I'm open for hire and cooperation. If you have an idea for a project, I'd love to discuss it with you. Also feel free to contact me for a music and sound recording job, or if you have a question about fitness and lifestyle.
